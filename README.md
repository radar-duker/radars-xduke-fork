# radars-xduke-fork
Backend updates to XDuke's ancient codebase

Compiled using Visual Studio 2008, which you can download from my Google drive folder here:

The project solution can easily be compiled in Visual Studio 2019.
After the solution is open and converted in VS2019, simply delete Game.rc from within the Game project, and it should compile.

After building the .exe, you will need SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll, which you can find in:
\lib\sdl
\lib\sdl_mixer
