Backend updates to XDuke's ancient codebase

Compiled using Visual Studio 2008, which you can download from my Google drive folder here:

With very little work, it can be upgraded to Visual Studio 2019.

After building the .exe, you will need SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll, which you can find in:
\lib\sdl
\lib\sdl_mixer
